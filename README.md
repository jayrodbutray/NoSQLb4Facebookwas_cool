## MongoDB allows you create social network API's and allows user to interact with each other. I was asked to create such web application where a user is able to interact with other users via their thoughts and add each other to their friend lists. This application allows a user to store friends and their thoughts, add and delete friends, and also add reactions to other users thoughts. You can also find users and thoughts through the application as well.

### My tutoring is always done with our instructor, Robbert. Because of the pace of the class, he has been my guide and so many online searches for answers to keep my head level while we go through so much detailed information at a fast pace.
